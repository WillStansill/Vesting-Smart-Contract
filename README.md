Vesting Contract
Overview
The Vesting Contract project implements a vesting mechanism using smart contracts. It allows the deployment of a vesting contract that can handle different roles (User, Partner, Team) with specific vesting schedules. The project includes a VestingContract smart contract, test cases, deployment scripts, and a helper configuration for different environments.

Project Structure
src/: Contains the main smart contracts.
VestingContract.sol: The main vesting contract.
script/: Contains deployment scripts and helper configurations.
DeployVestingContract.s.sol: Script to deploy the VestingContract.
HelperConfig.s.sol: Provides network-specific configurations and mock token deployment.
test/: Contains test cases for the VestingContract.
VestingContractTest.sol: Tests for the vesting contract.
lib/: Contains external libraries (e.g., OpenZeppelin contracts, Forge libraries).
Makefile: Build and deployment automation file.
forge.config.toml: Foundry configuration file.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm
Foundry (Forge)
Git
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Install the necessary dependencies:

bash
npm install
Install Foundry if you haven't already:

bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
Configuration
The HelperConfig library provides configurations for different networks:

Mainnet: Placeholder for the mainnet token address.
Sepolia: Uses a predefined token address.
Local: Deploys a mock ERC20 token for local development.
You can configure these settings as needed.

Testing
To run the tests for the VestingContract, use the following command:

bash
make test
The tests will validate the contractâ€™s functionality including vesting schedules, token claims, and edge cases.

Deployment
Local Deployment
To deploy the VestingContract on a local network:

bash
make deploy-local
Sepolia Testnet Deployment
To deploy the VestingContract on the Sepolia testnet:

bash
make deploy-sepolia
Mainnet Deployment
To deploy the VestingContract on the Ethereum mainnet:

bash
make deploy-mainnet
You can also use the deploy target with the network variable:

bash
make deploy network=local
make deploy network=sepolia
make deploy network=mainnet
Usage
Start Vesting: Call startVesting() to initialize the vesting period.
Add Beneficiary: Use addBeneficiary(address _beneficiary, Role _role, uint256 _totalAllocation) to add beneficiaries with their respective allocations.
Claim Tokens: Beneficiaries can call claimTokens() to claim their vested tokens once the cliff period is over.
Contract Details
VestingContract.sol: Implements the vesting logic with role-based allocations and token claiming.
VestingContractTest.sol: Provides unit tests for the vesting contract.
Example Usage
Here's a brief example of how to interact with the VestingContract:

solidity
// Deploying the contract
VestingContract vestingContract = new VestingContract(tokenAddress);

// Starting the vesting
vestingContract.startVesting();

// Adding a beneficiary
vestingContract.addBeneficiary(userAddress, VestingContract.Role.User, 1000 * 10 ** 18);

// Claiming tokens
vestingContract.claimTokens();
Troubleshooting
Deployment Issues: Ensure the correct network is selected and the token address is configured properly.
Test Failures: Verify the contract logic and test environment setup. Check for issues with the mock token or time manipulation in tests.
